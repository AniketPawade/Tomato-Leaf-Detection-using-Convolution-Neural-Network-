# Tomato-Leaf-Detection-using-Convolution-Neural-Network
Tomato is the most popular crop in the world,it is the crop which is cultivated worldwide. India ranked 2 in the production of tomato. However, the quality and quantity of tomato crop goes down due to the various kinds of diseases. So, to detect the disease a deep learning-based approach with local deployment used. For the disease detection and classification, a Convolution Neural Network based approach is applied.

**Dataset**

Images of Tomato disease have been taken from Plant Village dataset. The dataset includes over 50,000 images of 14 crops, such as tomatoes, potatoes, grapes, apples, corn, blueberry, raspberry, soybeans, squash and strawberry. We selected tomato as our target crop.

There are mainly nine types of diseases in tomato: 1) Target Spot, 2) Mosaic virus, 3) Bacterial spot, 4) Late blight, 5) Leaf Mold, 6) Yellow Leaf Curl Virus, 7) Spider mites: Two-spotted spider mite, 8) Early blight and 9) Septoria leaf spot. In proposed work, there are 10000 images in training dataset, 7000 images in validation dataset and 500 images in testing dataset. Out of 10000 training images, 1000 images belong to healthy category and 1000 images belong to each tomato disease category described above.
