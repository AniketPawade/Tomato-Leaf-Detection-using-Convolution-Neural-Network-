# Tomato-Leaf-Detection-using-Convolution-Neural-Network
Tomato is the most popular crop in the world,it is the crop which is cultivated worldwide. India ranked 2 in the production of tomato. However, the quality and quantity of tomato crop goes down due to the various kinds of diseases. So, to detect the disease a deep learning-based approach with local deployment used. For the disease detection and classification, a Convolution Neural Network based approach is applied.
